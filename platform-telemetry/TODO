# TODO

- ATTENTION: the project was implemented to give to other projects an API for traces but the idea was and is
  to replace it with a product available on the market (such a [Open Telemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/);
  actually will be a partial replacement by creating an API the made the platform dependant from this
  API and the implementing the facades for the third parties products; for sure the project is not
  complete (spans for example are limited to 1) and needs lot of work.
